[{"content":"Hello, my name is Ala Rai, and I\u0026rsquo;m a full-stack developer! It\u0026rsquo;s been 11 years since I first learned to code, and now I\u0026rsquo;m a full-stack developer. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a website at first, which was a bit unusual, but it was a great learning experience. For someone like me, who is naturally shy, it was a challenge to write about what I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about. I\u0026rsquo;m aware that my intro might seem a bit awkward and that my grammar could use some improvement, but I\u0026rsquo;m working on it! This website is going to be my training ground for writing!\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing my insights on software engineering based on my experience, as well as my thoughts on some tech trends. Anything that\u0026rsquo;s on my mind, I\u0026rsquo;ll be putting in this website!\nSo, this is just a short introductory post. Thank you so much for reading! ðŸ˜Š\n","permalink":"https://alaraiabdiallah.github.io/posts/hello-world/","summary":"Hello, my name is Ala Rai, and I\u0026rsquo;m a full-stack developer!
