Beep beep... Hello my name Ala Rai a Full Stack Developer. It's been 11 years since my first time to learn code until now I become Full Stack Developer but I haven't website, kinda weird right?😅. For shy person like me to write something in my mind very it's very very challenging. Maybe you notice this intro kinda awkward and the grammars are bad, because I really bad in grammars. This website will be my training field for writing.

I will write about software engineering based on my experience, maybe my opinion about some tech trends, it's about something in my though I will try to put in this website 😊.

Soooo this write only short introductory. Thank you ✌️
