Hello, my name is Ala Rai, and I'm a full-stack developer! It's been 11 years since I first learned to code, and now I'm a full-stack developer. I didn't have a website at first, which was a bit unusual, but it was a great learning experience. For someone like me, who is naturally shy, it was a challenge to write about what I'm passionate about. I'm aware that my intro might seem a bit awkward and that my grammar could use some improvement, but I'm working on it! This website is going to be my training ground for writing!

I'll be sharing my insights on software engineering based on my experience, as well as my thoughts on some tech trends. Anything that's on my mind, I'll be putting in this website!

So, this is just a short introductory post. Thank you so much for reading! ðŸ˜Š
